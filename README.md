# Custom Elements Polyfill

The main reason for this polyfill is that it supports nested components via innerHTML, appendChild etc...

Just clone the repository and include the polyfill via script tag. You can also see the example.

If IE11 support is needed, ES6 syntax needs to be transpiled by Babel.
